When I was just seven years old, my father gifted my brother and me a laptop. This seemingly simple event marked a significant turning point in my life. For one, it opened up a world of infinite exploration, unveiling a universe of knowledge and ideas right at my fingertips. The device fascinated me, captivating my interest from the first moment I saw it. I fell in love with the complexity hidden behind its simplicity. It was then that a question started to germinate in my young mind: how was this incredible device created? This question not only sparked my curiosity but also set me on a lifelong path of discovery. From that point onwards, I committed myself to find answers to this question. The journey of revelation led me to explore numerous research papers and delve into various resources on the internet, collecting a plethora of information that fueled my ideas about going beyond the boundaries of the known universe.

## Leaving Home and Entering a New World

When I turned nine, my playful nature and mischievous behaviour were at their peak. I didn't take my studies seriously, much to my father's concern. Seeing this, he decided that a change of environment might help instill some discipline in me. Thus, he suggested that I join a reputed boarding school named "Motilal Nehru School of Sports." This school was known far and wide as one of the best disciplinary schools in India at that time. The admission process was challenging, involving four competitive tests that I had to clear. It was a tough journey, considering that more than 10,000 applicants vied for a mere 100 spots. However, I managed to secure a place in this institution and embarked on a new journey. The school had strict rules and regulations; computers and mobile phones were not permitted. But, this didn't deter me. I continued my quest, learning more about computers by reading books, and during vacations at home, I spent every single minute on the internet, quenching my thirst for knowledge.

## Sports Achievements

The school was also famous for its emphasis on sports. Seeing this as another avenue for growth, I joined the school's gymnastics team. I learned to play acrobatics, usually in a mixed pair. I found immense joy in learning new elements and performing them to music with my talented partner, Yuvakshi. My dedication and hard work led me to become a state-level champion in gymnastics, and I secured positions at the national level as well. Apart from gymnastics, my interest in strategic games led me to the world of chess. I played chess online, participated in various tournaments, and won many of them. I also ventured into the world of esports, specifically Call of Duty. My skills in the game earned me a spot in the world championship, with my current rankings being Pro1 in Battle Royale and Elite5 in Multiplayer.

## Applying Knowledge and Skills to Solve Real World Problems

In 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world, and the ensuing lockdown was imposed, I saw it not as a restriction but as an opportunity. While the world was grappling with the new reality, I utilized this time to learn and enhance my horizons of computer knowledge. I started learning various programming languages and delved into web development. I even tackled complex programming languages like Rust, knowing that these skills would be essential for building things in the future world of web3. Once the lockdown ended and the world started to reopen, I began attending hackathons, conferences, and meets. I won numerous hackathons and was a speaker at various conferences, including the Solana Hackerhaus. With my efforts, I became a member of Superteam DAO and a contributor to Solana. I've worked on and launched several projects, such as:

- ShastraOS: The world's first decentralized operating system, based on Linux and connected to blockchains. It offers high security and a superior user interface, surpassing even Windows and macOS.
- Almera: A decentralized platform for publishing work, ensuring 100% ownership to the publisher because of its decentralized nature and the use of web3 technology.
- Jatayu: A software that uses data from CCTV to analyze human motion patterns.

Moreover, I've used my skills to assist my school departments by building software for them.

## My Academics

At the tender age of ten, I realized that the formal education system didn't align with my interests or future aspirations. The rigid structure and limited scope of traditional academics didn't quench my thirst for knowledge. Therefore, I began exploring the realms of technology and science through alternative resources. I replaced academic books with informative science journals and relied more on the internet than traditional teaching. However, my academic journey hasn't always been smooth. I've encountered hurdles, struggled with some subjects, and haven't achieved high scores in exams. Despite these challenges, my pursuit of knowledge remains undeterred.

## My Dream and Ideas about Quantum Computers

As I dove deeper into the world of science, I came to realize that there is another world apart from ours, a world with different rules and laws. Quantum mechanics introduced me to this fascinating realm, and I developed a desire to explore it further. I want to dedicate my life to this exploration, to unravel the mysteries of this quantum world. In the quest for understanding, I spend every available hour learning about quantum computers. I'm researching how to use them to open a gateway to that universe we see in Marvel movies. I am confident that one day quantum computers will make this possible. My journey, sparked by a simple laptop at the age of seven, continues, and I look forward to where it will take me next.
