When I was just seven years old, my father gifted my brother and me a laptop. This seemingly simple event marked a significant turning point in my life. For one, it opened up a world of infinite exploration, unveiling a universe of knowledge and ideas right at my fingertips. The device fascinated me, captivating my interest from the first moment I saw it. I fell in love with the complexity hidden behind its simplicity. It was then that a question started to germinate in my young mind: how was this incredible device created? This question not only sparked my curiosity but also set me on a lifelong path of discovery. From that point onwards, I committed myself to find answers to this question. The journey of revelation led me to explore numerous research papers and delve into various resources on the internet, collecting a plethora of information that fueled my ideas about going beyond the boundaries of the known universe.
